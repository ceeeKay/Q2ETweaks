# QE2Tweaks

A collection of "tweaks" (small mods) for Quake 2 Enhanced multiplayer servers.

All tweaks are off (0) by default and need to be set on (1) before starting a map.

## Faster Blasters

server game variable: `g_faster_blasters`

Makes blaster shots travel faster: 5000 instead of 1500 (blaster) and 1000 (hyperblaster)

Also adjusts `sv_maxvelocity` from default of 2000 to 5000.

## Spawn With Chainfist

Everybody needs a good melee weapon. Give players a chainfist when they spawn!

## Spawn With Shotgun

server game variable: `g_spawn_with_shotgun`

Give newly-spawned players a fighting chance. Give them a shotgun when they spawn!
