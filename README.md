# QE2Tweaks

A collection of "tweaks" (small mods) for Quake 2 Enhanced multiplayer servers.

## Faster Blasters

server game variable: `g_faster_blasters`

Makes blaster shots travel faster: 5000 instead of 1500 (blaster) and 1000 (hyperblaster)

Also adjusts `sv_maxvelocity` from default of 2000 to 5000.
